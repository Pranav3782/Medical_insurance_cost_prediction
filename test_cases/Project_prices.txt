To create prices based on the attributes in the provided dataset,
 we can consider a simple pricing model that assigns values to each attribute. 
 Below is an example of how you might approach this:

##Pricing Model:
Age: ₹100 for every year.
Sex:
Female: ₹200
Male: ₹150
BMI: ₹50 for every unit.
Children: ₹500 for each child.
Smoker:
Yes: ₹1000
No: ₹0
Example Calculation:
Given an entry:
##
Age: 30
Sex: Female
BMI: 25.5
Children: 2
Smoker: Yes
Price Calculation:
##
Age: 30 × ₹100 = ₹3000
Sex (Female): ₹200
BMI: 25.5 × ₹50 = ₹1275
Children: 2 × ₹500 = ₹1000
Smoker: ₹1000
Total Price = ₹3000 + ₹200 + ₹1275 + ₹1000 + ₹1000 = ₹6475

##Pricing Model:
Age:
₹100 per year (considering age-related health insurance or services).
Sex:
Female: ₹200
Male: ₹150
BMI:
₹50 per BMI unit (reflecting potential health costs related to weight).
Children:
₹500 per child (considering costs for education, healthcare, etc.).
Smoker:
Yes: ₹1000 (reflecting higher health risks and insurance costs).
No: ₹0

I’ve added a "prices" column to your dataset based on the following simplified 
assumptions for medical insurance costs in Indian Rupees (INR):

Base cost: ₹5,000.
Age: Increases by ₹200 per year of age.
BMI: Adds ₹150 for each unit of BMI above 25.
Children: Adds ₹300 per child.
Smoker: Adds ₹3,000 if the person is a smoker.
Here are the first few results:

For a 19-year-old smoker with a BMI of 27.9 and no children: ₹12,235.
For an 18-year-old non-smoker with a BMI of 33.77 and 1 child: ₹10,215.50.
For a 28-year-old non-smoker with a BMI of 33 and 3 children: ₹12,700.

##
Here’s an overview of how we can assign basic weightage:

Base cost: A fixed starting value (e.g., ₹5,000 for non-smokers).
Age: Insurance costs typically increase with age.
Sex: Minimal or no difference in many pricing systems.
BMI: Higher BMI often leads to higher premiums due to health risks.
Children: More dependents may increase costs slightly.
Smoker: Smokers usually pay more due to associated health risks.
We can create a simplified formula for the price calculation like this:


Price=Base cost+(Age factor)+(BMI factor)+(Children factor)+(Smoker factor)
